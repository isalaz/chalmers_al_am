This repository contains the code used to produce figures, images and tables that were used in manuscripts. It includes loading, processing and modeling of data from various experiments. 
### Scanning X-ray Fluorescence measurements (XRF). 
These experiments were performed at two separate synchrotron facilities
- ID16B beamline at the European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble
  - Scanning X-ray fluorescence
  - Heating/cooling ramps
- P06 beamline at the PETRA III synchrotron, DESY, Hamburg
  - Scanning X-ray fluorescence
  - Simultanueous acquisition of transmission diffraction for Coherent Diffraction Imaging
    - Using the Eiger4M 2D detector
### (S)TEM
These experiments were performed using the JEOL 3000F microscope at nCHREM, Lund Unviersity, Sweden. 
Data from this experiment consists of 
- TEM mode imaging (S)
  - Bright field TEM imaging
  - Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED)
  - Dark Field TEM imaging
- STEM mode imaging
  - HAADF mode
- EDX/EDS elemental mapping 
  - Spectral images as data cubes (.raw + .rpl)
  - Point acquisitions as individual spectra
